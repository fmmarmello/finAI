# **App Name**: FinAI

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Allow users to sign up and log in using email/password, Google, or Apple.
- Manual Entry: Enable users to manually add expenses and income with fields for description, amount, date, category (with AI suggestions), and source.
- Automatic Document Reading: Process uploaded PDF or image files of receipts and credit card statements (Ita√∫, Porto Seguro, Nubank) to extract transaction data using ML Kit. The system is capable of learning distinct invoice layouts.
- Smart Categorization: Use a pre-trained AI model (via Vertex AI or TensorFlow Lite) to automatically categorize transactions based on descriptions. Allow users to correct categories and use this feedback to retrain the model, a process which functions as an intelligent 'tool' for the user's benefit.
- Dashboard: Present key financial data, including expense distribution by category, monthly balance, and a list of recent transactions, in a dashboard.
- AI-Powered Insights: Analyze user spending habits and provide insights such as trend analysis, anomaly detection (e.g., duplicate charges), identification of recurring subscriptions, and expense predictions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#29ABE2) to evoke trust and clarity, reflecting the app's focus on financial management.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), a very low saturation, brighter tint of the primary hue, creating a clean and professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Green (#90EE90) to highlight positive actions and key insights.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for a modern and precise look; use 'Inter' as the body font, as this pairing works nicely.
- Use clear, minimalist icons for categories and actions to enhance usability.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout to facilitate easy navigation and data comprehension.
- Implement subtle animations for user feedback and data loading to enhance the overall user experience.
